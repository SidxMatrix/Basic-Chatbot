🧠 Rex AI Assistant – Smart, Simple, and Continuously Evolving

Rex AI Assistant is a web-based chatbot built using Flask, designed to deliver quick and context-aware responses to user queries. It integrates multiple third-party APIs to offer a wide range of functionality—from real-time weather reports and language translation to word definitions and basic time info for cities around the world.

Currently, Rex supports:

* 🔍 **Google Search Integration:** Get concise summaries of your queries using the Google Custom Search API.
* 🌤️ **Weather Updates:** Get real-time weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and more using OpenWeatherMap.
* 🌐 **Text Translation:** Translate any English sentence into various languages via the MyMemory Translation API.
* 📖 **Word Definitions:** Lookup meanings, phonetics, parts of speech, and examples through DictionaryAPI.
* 🕒 **City Time Info:** Displays a basic server-side time for any city (timezone accuracy coming soon).
* 💬 **Chat History:** Retains the last 50 chat entries in memory for session context.
* 🚀 **REST API Ready:** Easily connect your own frontend via simple POST/GET endpoints.
